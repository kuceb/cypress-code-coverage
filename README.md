# cypress-code-coverage
A repo to help you with code coverage + cypress

## About 
the strategy is:

- instrument your app code so that coverage is generated on `window.__coverage__`
- after cypress spec runs, use `cy.writeFile` to save the report to `.nyc_output`
- and generate the report with `cy.exec('nyc report --reporter=html')`

**you should then be able the view the html coverage report in the `coverage/` directory**
